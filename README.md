To implement a linear regression model for predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, you can use Python with libraries such as **scikit-learn** and **pandas**. First, gather and prepare the dataset, ensuring it includes the required features and the target variable (house prices). Use **pandas** to load and preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from **scikit-learn**. Next, create a linear regression model using `LinearRegression` from **scikit-learn**, train it on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the test set using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. Visualize the results with plots, such as scatter plots of actual vs. predicted prices, to assess the model's accuracy. Fine-tune the model by normalizing the features or using feature selection techniques if necessary.
